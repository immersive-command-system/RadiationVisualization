# Scene Documentation

## RadiationHololensDemo
This test out the radiation

## SampleScene
This should just be your run of the mill autogenerated Unity scene.

## ScanningHololensDemo
This tests out the LiDAR scanning visualization.
### Scripts
 - [LidarVisualizer.cs](../Scripts/Visualization/LidarVisualizer.cs)
   - Attached to the drone model as a component.
   - Parameters:
     - `Initial Particle Count`
     - `Update Interval`
     - `Flip YZ`
 - [ScanningConnection.cs](../Scripts/ROS/Scanning/ScanningConnection.cs)
   - Attached to Rosbridge Connection. This is an empty game object.
   - Runs the RosBridge connection and attaches PointCloud2Subscriber.cs
   - Parameters:
     - `Ip`: ip address to listen to for the RosBridge connection. The script will listen to `ws://<Ip>:9090`
 - [PointCloud2Subscriber.cs](../Scripts/ROS/Scanning/PointCloud2Subscriber.cs)
   - Extends `ROSBridgeSubscriber`
   - ROSBridge Subscriber that is run in the background.
   - This object parses LiDAR pointcloud2 data and sends it to LidarVisualizer as a `PointCloud<PointXYZIntensity>`.
   - Topic: `velodyne/velodyne_points`
   - Utilizes PointCloud2Msg.cs
 - [PointCloud2Msg.cs](../Scripts/ROS/Scanning/PointCloud2Msg.cs)
   - Extends `ROSBridgeMsg`
   - Called in the background by PointCloud2Subscriber.cs
   - Parses pointcloud2 data and converts it into a `PointCloud<PointXYZIntensity>` object
     - Access with `GetCloud()`

## Visualization
VR? Application. Not entirely sure this is legacy.
